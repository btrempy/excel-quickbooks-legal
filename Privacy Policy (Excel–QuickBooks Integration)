ðŸ§¾ Privacy Policy (Excelâ€“QuickBooks Integration)
Effective Date: 07/30/2025
Last Updated: 07/30/2025
This Excel-based application integrates with Intuit's QuickBooks API to provide automated financial workflows. We value your privacy and follow best practices in handling your data:
- Data Storage: We do not store financial or personal data outside your local environment. All data remains within Excel unless explicitly transmitted to Intuitâ€™s secure servers.
- Access Scope: The app only accesses the minimum necessary QuickBooks data required to support your selected workflows.
- OAuth Authentication: Tokens are securely stored using Excelâ€™s protected ranges and are not shared externally.
- Third Parties: No third-party tools receive your data â€” integration is direct between Excel and Intuit.
- Security Practices: Sensitive fields (like client ID and secret) are dynamically referenced and encrypted using Excel-based security methods.
